Building Hempl
==============

If you decide to build your own binary image, you need to download the
source code and follow the platform specific build instructions. Then
follow the instructions below to configure and build your Hempl binary
image.

Configuring the build image
===========================

Hempl has a very flexible build system that can be used to select the
components that are going to be part of the binary image and also to
set the compile time (static) configuration.  To use it, you need to
edit a single configuration file located in the platform specific
directory [1]. The configuration parameters are described in detail in
the next paragraphs.

Configuring components
======================

A Hempl component is a feature that can be enabled to add
functionality to Hempl itself without modifying its API. An example of
component configuration from platform_conf.h is given below:

// *****************************************************************************
// Define here what components you want for this platform

#define BUILD_SHELL
#define BUILD_ADVANCED_SHELL
#define BUILD_XMODEM
#define BUILD_ADC
#define BUILD_LCD
#define BUILD_RTC
#define BUILD_TERM
#define BUILD_UIP
#define BUILD_KS0108B

The components that can be configured in Hempl are:

BUILD_SHELL: This builds the Hempl shell (see using.txt for details on
the shell). If the shell is not enabled, the code looks for a file
called /rom/autorun.l and executes it.  If this file is not found, a
regular PicoLisp intepreter is started on the target. To enable the
shell over a serial connection:

#define BUILD_SHELL
#define BUILD_CON_GENERIC

Note: Enabling the shell over a TCP/IP connection is not supported yet.

// *****************************************************************************

BUILD_ROMFS: Enable the Hempl read-only filesystem. See the ROMFS
documentation for details on using the ROM file system. To enable:

#define BUILD_ROMFS

// *****************************************************************************

BUILD_MMCFS: Enable the Hempl SD/MMC FAT filesystem support. To
enable:

#define BUILD_MMCFS

Static configuration data dependencies: MMCFS_TICK_HZ, MMCFS_TICK_MS,
MMCFS_CS_PORT, MMCFS_CS_PIN, MMCFS_SPI_NUM

// *****************************************************************************

BUILD_TERM: Enable ANSI terminal support. It allows Hempl to interact
with terminals that support ANSI escape sequences. Currently it works
only over RS-232 connections, although this is not a strict
requirement. You need to enable this if you want to use the term
module. To enable:

#define BUILD_TERM

Static configuration data dependencies: CON_UART_ID, CON_UART_SPEED,
CON_TIMER_ID, CON_FLOW_TYPE, TERM_LINES, TERM_COLS

// *****************************************************************************

BUILD_CON_GENERIC: Generic console support (checkcon_term.txt in doc/
for details).  Enables console access (stdio/stdout/stderr) via a
serial transport (currently RS-232, but others can be
supported). Enable this if you want to use console input/output over
your RS-232 connection. To enable:

#define BUILD_CON_GENERIC

Static configuration data dependencies: CON_UART_ID, CON_UART_SPEED,
CON_TIMER_ID, CON_FLOW_TYPE

// *****************************************************************************

BUILD_ADC: Define this to build support for ADC peripherals. This must
be enabled to use the adc module or the adc platform interface. To
enable:

#define BUILD_ADC

Static configuration data dependencies: ADC_BIT_RESOLUTION, ADC_TIMER_FIRST_ID,
ADC_NUM_TIMERS, BUF_ENABLE_ADC, ADC_BUF_SIZE

// *****************************************************************************

BUILD_C_INT_HANDLERS: Enable generic interrupt support in the C
code. check doc/int_handlers.txt for details. To enable:

#define BUILD_C_INT_HANDLERS

// *****************************************************************************

BUILD_LINENOISE: Enables linenoise support, check here for details. To
enable:

#define BUILD_LINENOISE

Static configuration data dependencies: LINENOISE_HISTORY_SIZE_PICOC,
LINENOISE_HISTORY_SIZE_SHELL, LINENOISE_AUTOSAVE_FNAME

// *****************************************************************************

Configuring modules
===================

You can also choose the modules that are going to be part of the Hempl
image. Unlike components, the modules have a direct impact on the
Hempl API, so choose them carefully.  Disabling a module will save
Flash space (and potentially RAM) but will also completely remove the
possibility of using that module from the Hempl system.

The modules included in the build are specified by the different
macros. The macros configure different things for the system.

1. PICOLISP_PLATFORM_LIBS_ROM

Example:

// platform library functions
#define PICOLISP_PLATFORM_LIBS_ROM\
  _ROM(PD)\
  _ROM(TERM)\
  _ROM(MIZAR32_LCD)\
  _ROM(ELUA)\
  _ROM(CPU)\
  _ROM(TIMER)\
  _ROM(I2C)\
  _ROM(PWM)\
  _ROM(SPI)\
  _ROM(PIO)\
  _ROM(UART)\
  ADCLINE

This macro is used to control the inclusion of the different core C
components that are going to accessed from PicoLisp.

For example: commenting _ROM(MIZAR32_LCD) will remove the possibility
of writing to the Mizar32 LCD module from PicoLisp once built.

Static configuration data
=========================

"Static configuration" refers to the compile-time
configuration. Static configuration parameters are hard-coded in the
firmware image and can’t be changed at run-time. The list below
provides the static configuration parameters and their semantics.

// *****************************************************************************

CON_UART_ID, CON_UART_SPEED, CON_TIMER_ID, CON_FLOW_TYPE:

Used to configure console input/output over UART. The specified UART
id will be used for console input/output, at the specified speed. The
data format is always 8N1 (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bits). The
specified timer ID will be used for the console subsystem. These
variables are also used by the XMODEM and TERM implementations. If
CON_FLOW_TYPE is defined the specified, flow control is applied to the
console UART interface. If not defined it defaults to no flow control.

// *****************************************************************************

TERM_LINES, TERM_COLS

Used to configure the ANSI terminal support (if enabled in the
build). Used to specify (respectively) the number of lines and columns
of the ANSI terminal.

// *****************************************************************************

VTMR_NUM_TIMERS, VTMR_FREQ_HZ

Specify the virtual timers configuration for the platform (refer to
the timer module documentation for details). Define VTMR_NUM_TIMERS to
0 if this feature is not used.

// *****************************************************************************

MMCFS_TICK_HZ, MMCFS_TICK_MS

Specify the rate at which SD/MMC timer function disk_timerproc() are
being called by the platform. On most platforms MMCFS_TICK_HZ will
match VTMR_FREQ_HZ. Only needed if MMCFS support is enabled.

// *****************************************************************************

MMCFS_CS_PORT, MMCFS_CS_PIN

Specify the port and pin to be used as chip select for MMCFS control
of an SD/MMC card over SPI. Only needed if MMCFS support is enabled.

// *****************************************************************************

MMCFS_SPI_NUM

Specify the SPI peripheral to be used by MMCFS. Only needed if MMCFS
support is enabled.

// *****************************************************************************

PLATFORM_CPU_CONSTANTS

NOTE: This static configuration data is currently not supported by
Hempl. This will be enabled after interrupt support for Hempl is
established. For now, you may ignore this.

If the cpu module is enabled, this defines a list of platform-specific
constants (for example interrupt masks) that can be accessed using the
cpu.<constant name> notation. Each constant name must be specified
instead of a specific costruct _CPU_CONSTANT(<constant name>).  For
example:

#define PLATFORM_CPU_CONSTANTS\
        _CPU_CONSTANT(INT_GPIOA),\
        _CPU_CONSTANT(INT_GPIOB),\
        _CPU_CONSTANT(INT_GPIOC),\
        _CPU_CONSTANT(INT_GPIOD),\
        _CPU_CONSTANT(INT_GPIOE),\
        _CPU_CONSTANT(INT_UART0),\

After compilation, you can access these constants from PicoC. Note
that the implementation of this feature needs virtually no RAM at all,
so you can define as many constants as you want here.

// *****************************************************************************

BUF_ENABLE_ADC

If the adc module is enabled, this controls whether or not the ADC
will create a buffer so that more than one sample per channel can be
held in a buffer before being returned through adc_getsample or
adc_getsamples. If disabled, only one conversion result will be
buffered. This option does NOT affect the behavior of the moving
average filter.

// *****************************************************************************

ADC_BUF_SIZE

If the adc module is enabled, and BUF_ENABLE_ADC is defined, this will
define the default buffer length allocated at startup. This does not
limit buffer sizes, it only defines the default length. Appropriate
values range from BUF_SIZE_2 to BUF_SIZE_32768, with the numeric
component at the end being in powers of 2.

// *****************************************************************************

ADC_BIT_RESOLUTION

If the adc module is enabled, this will define the number of bits per
adc conversion result.  This is used to determine the maximum
conversion value that can be returned by the ADC.

// *****************************************************************************

LINENOISE_HISTORY_SIZE_PICOLISP

If linenoise support is enabled, this defines the number of lines kept
in history for the PicoLisp interpreter. If history support in
PicoLisp is not needed, define this as 0.

// *****************************************************************************

LINENOISE_HISTORY_SIZE_SHELL

If linenoise support is enabled, this defines the number of lines kept
in history for the Hempl shell. If history support in the shell is not
needed, define this as 0.

// *****************************************************************************

LINENOISE_AUTOSAVE_FNAME

If linenoise support is enabled, the history will automatically be
saved everytime the PicoLisp interpreter exits in the filename
specified by this macro. This macro is optional; if it’s not defined,
the history will not be saved automatically.

// *****************************************************************************

The rest of the static configuration data parameters are meant to be
modified mainly by developers and thus they’re not listed here. One
more thing you might want to configure for your build is the contents
of the ROM file system. See the ROMFS documentation for details on how
to do this.

Invoking the build system
=========================

Once you have everything in place, all you have to do is to invoke the
build system (using scons) with the right arguments. This is a fairly
easy step, although it might look intimidating because of the
multitude of options than can be given to scons. They are used to fine
tune the final image to your specific needs, but unless your needs are
very special you won’t need to modify them, so don’t worry about the
apparent complexity. The examples at the end of this section will show
how easy it is to use the build system in practice.

From your GNU/Linux terminal:

$ scons
  [target=regular]
  [build_date = 0 | 1]
  [cpu=<cpuname>]
  [board=<boardname>]
  [allocator = newlib | multiple | simple]
  [toolchain = <toolchain name>]
  [optram = 0 | 1]
  [romfs = verbatim]
  [prog]

Your build target is specified by two paramters: cpu and board. "cpu"
gives the name of your CPU, and "board" the name of the board. A board
can be associated with more than one CPU. This allows the build system
to be very flexible. You can use these two options together or
separately, as shown below:

* build_date=0 | 1: If true, the build date will be appended to the
  output file name (the hex/bin file).
  

* cpu=name: build for the specified CPU. A board name will be assigned
            by the build system automatically.

* board=name: build for the specified board. The CPU name will be
            inferred by the build system automatically.

* cpu=name board=name: build for the specified board and CPU. The
            build script won’t allow invalid CPU/board combinations.

For board/CPU assignment, look at the beginning of the SConstruct file
(the platform_list), it’s self-explanatory. The other options are as
follows:

* allocator = newlib | multiple | simple: choose between the default
  newlib allocator (newlib) which is an older version of dlmalloc, the
  multiple memory spaces allocator (multiple) which is a newer version
  of dlmalloc that can handle multiple memory spaces, and a very
  simple memory allocator (simple) that is slow and doesn’t handle
  fragmentation very well, but it requires very few resources
  (Flash/RAM). You should use the multiple allocator only if you need
  to support multiple memory spaces (for example boards that have
  external RAM). You should use simple only on resource constrained
  systems.

* toolchain=<toolchain name>: this specifies the name of the toolchain
  used to build the image.

* optram=0 | 1: enables or disables the miniCodeROM support. See the
  miniCodeROM documentation for more details. The default is 0 for
  now.  The miniCodeROM integration with Hempl will be supported in a
  future release. You may ignore this option until then.

* prog: by default, the above scons command will build only the elf
  (executable) file.  Specify "prog" to build also the
  platform-specific programming file where appropriate (for example,
  on an at32uc3a0512, this results in a .hex file that can be
  programmed in the CPU).

* romfs = verbatim: ROMFS compilation mode. Check the ROMFS
  documentation for details.

* boot = standard: Boot mode. standard will boot to either a shell or
  PicoLisp interactive prompt.

The output will be a file named hempl_[cpu].elf (and also another file
with the same name but ending in .bin/.hex if "prog" was specified for
platforms that need these files for programming). If you want the
equivalent of a "make clean", invoke "scons" as shown above, but add a
"-c" at the end of the command line.

A few examples
==============

1. $ scons cpu=at32uc3a0512 -c

Clear previously built intermediate files.

2. scons cpu=at32uc3a0512

Build Hempl for the AT32UC3A0512 CPU. The board name is detected as
Mizar32.

3. scons board=et-stm32

Build Hempl for the ET-STM32 board (stamp module). The CPU is detected
as STM32F103RE.

4. scons cpu=at32uc3a0512 toolchain=avr32-gcc prog

Build the image for the Mizar32-A board and uses the avr32-gcc
toolchain from Atmel.
